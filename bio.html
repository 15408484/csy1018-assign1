		<p>	I was born in Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk on July 25th 1997, and i have grown up and lived in the area ever since, 
			going to Ickworth Park Primary School, followed by Horringer Court Middle School and completing my GCSE's and A-levels at County Upper School.
			Currently, I am attending the University of Northampton, taking Computing.

			I have a few hobbies, such as playing guitar and singing, playing tabletop games like Magic: the Gathering and playing video games. I have been
			playing guitar for around 3 years now and I taught myself from the very start, I also attend Open Mic nights in my local area and occasionally I play
			at public events.
